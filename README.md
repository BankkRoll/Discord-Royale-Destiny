  - `Admins Only`: Only server admins can start a battle.
  - `Role-Based`: A specific role is allowed to start battles.
- **Behavior**:

---

#### `/set-winning-role`

---

#### `/remove-winning-role`
- **Purpose**: Remove the role assigned to winners of battles.

  - `era`: The name of the era (e.g., `modern`, `futuristic`, `medieval`).
- **Behavior**:

## üéÆ How It Works  

### **Admin Flow**:  
1. Use `/set-game` to define who can start games.  
2. Configure gameplay with `/set-era` and `/set-timer`.  
3. Assign special roles for winners using `/set-winning-role`.  
4. Start a battle with `/start {era}`.  

### **Game Flow**:  
1. **Game Start**:  
   - The bot sends an embed with a progress bar (updated every 10%), join/leave buttons, and battle details.  

2. **Player Actions**:  
   - Players join by clicking the **Join** button.  
   - They can leave before the game starts using the **Leave** button.  

3. **Battle Simulation**:  
   - Once the timer ends, the bot pairs players randomly for combat.  
   - Players attack and defend using era-specific items.  
   - The simulation continues until one player is declared the **winner**.  

4. **Winner Announcement**:  
   - The bot announces the winner in the channel and assigns the winning role (if configured).
